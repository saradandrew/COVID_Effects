# COVID Effects

## Overview
This analysis looks at new COVID cases, COVID deaths, and starting and ending price of the stock market from late January 2020 through June of 2020. The data was transformed into tables and used to create a dashboard containing visualizations of the data.

## Results
The northeast region saw the most COVID deaths with the state of New York experiencing 1,929 deaths alone. The data also reveals that there was a 7.3% increase in stock market closing price from January 21, 2020 to June 30, 2020.

## Challenges
A challenge I faced while creating the dashboard was changing the slicer to a date format. I ensured slicer connections were formatted correctly, but it still would not appear as a date format.
